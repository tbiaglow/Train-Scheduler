# Train-Scheduler
This app allows the user to store information on train schedules in Firebase database. The user inputs the train name, its final destination, it's first time of the day, and the frequency (how often the train runs the route). The app then calculates the train's next arrival based on the current time, and displays this information at the top of the page.
